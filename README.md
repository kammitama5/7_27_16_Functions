functions in Elixir practice

Working on learning Elixir daily so making a few functions of my own
.exs are functions and .ex are modules. 
In interactive mode, run c("nameofmodule.ex") and then run "nameofModule.func(input)" to run.
Functions can be run in the command line by running elixir Function.exs.
